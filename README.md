# DaYu-GCP
DaYu-GCP: All-day Global Cloud Physical Properties Dataset with 0.07° Resolution Retrieved from Geostationary Satellite Imagers (2000-2022)

The DaYu-GCP is retrieved using infrared brightness temperatures at 6.7 µm and 11 µm. It provides a long-term, all-day global cloud physical properties product with a spatial resolution of 0.07° and a temporal resolution of 3 hours, spanning from 2000 to 2022. The dataset covers the region from -70° to 70° in latitude and from -180° to 180° in longitude. The dataset include four variables: cloud phase (CLP), cloud top height (CTH), cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud effective radius (CER).

Detailed information:

3h temporal resolution is UTC time 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 hours daily.

CLP: 0 clear, 1 liquid, 2 ice; missing: NaN.

CTH: CTH in km; missing: NaN; range [0, 18].

COT: COT in unitless; missing: NaN; range [0, 150].

CER: CER in µm; missing: NaN; range [0, 60].
